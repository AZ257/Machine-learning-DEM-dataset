# Machine-learning-DEM-elevation-error-regression-prediction-dataset
#The production of datasets is based on existing source DEMs, and they can be downloaded from the official website. 
#Creating a machine learning DEM elevation regression prediction dataset includes extraction of feature factors and calculation of elevation errors. 
#Among them, there are two methods for extracting feature factors. The first is to extract the terrain feature factors of the source DEM based on ArcGIS software, 
#and the second is to calculate the terrain feature factors of the source DEM based on Python code. 
#The DEM elevation error is calculated by making the difference between the source DEM elevation and the control point ICESAT-2. 
#Finally, the extracted feature factors and elevation errors are integrated into a regression prediction data set file to complete the dataset production.
